# Ethernet Demo Application

this repository contains demo applications for pulpissimo hardware design extended with a ethernet mac and ptp functionality.

## Dirty
this demo applications initially was implemented to test basic functionality of uDMA peripheral (udma_eth_frame and udma_ptp_ts). a dummy ethernet frame is sent via ethernet mac (tx) and received ethernet frames (rx) are printed to uart output. further it read the generated ptp timestamps during transmission and reception of ethernet frames.

## ptp_app
